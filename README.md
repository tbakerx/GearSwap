### Motivation
While traveling Southeast Asia, my buddy and I came across a problem that was extremely common within the backpacking community. When living out of nothing but a backpack for long periods of time, having enough pack space is almost as important as having enough gear. This balance is tricky to maintain and almost every traveller we met either overpacked or underpacked. If only there was a way to easily connect people that need specific items (warm jackets, new flip flops, etc) with people that packed way too much and need to unload some things. This is what we aim to do with GearSwap! We hope to make it quick and easy for travellers to connect to swap, pick up, or unload items. No more leaving your unused clothes for the hostel owners to deal with ;)
